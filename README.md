# Crosshair

crosshair.txt, frag_shader.txt, and vertex_shader.txt are the crosshair shape, fragment shader, and vertex shader, respectively. They are used to draw the crosshair in the center of the screen.

There is a default crosshair, but it can be changed by modifying the respective file

# Crosshair Shape
The crosshair is made up of vertices, which are defined in this format:
x1,y1;x2,y2;x3,y3;x4,y4
